! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

## Context

Official Classic is announced and will be released some day.
There are plenty of 1x Vanilla servers with corrupt staff looking for the next quick cash grab.
Servers are volatile, thus 1x rates are inappropriate for adults looking for Vanilla endgame.

Project Blitz was initiated on Friday the 13th of July 2018, after "NeoFeenix" failed.
One day later a test server was set up and made available to the community.

Project Blitz is intended to end (latest), when official Classic (beta) servers can be played.
When the project ends, a database dump without account names/password hashes might be published.


## Project Blitz key values

* Transparent processes, automation and community involvement
* Attainable Vanilla experience for people playing less than full-time
* Play-worthy server, not targetting the 1x "full bli*zlike" 10000 player crowd
* PvP is no afterthought
* PvE scripting does not need to be perfect, but playable


## The hardware, money, staff and the admin

* The server has good hardware and should be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent players
* The server is located in Warsaw and advertised as "DDoS protection included", will see how this holds

* Current operational cost: 65.99 Euro per month, handled by my private funds
* There will not be a donation/cash shop ever

* All work is done by volunteers without compensation, passionate players of Vanilla

* I am a professional software engineer and will remain the only admin with access to the infrastructure
* Since I am kind of a bottleneck, I will give updates on my availability in Discord
* My current default availability schedule:

  - Mon: 20:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Tue: 22:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Wed: 20:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Thu: 22:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Fri: 23:00 - 24:00 + 1 or 2h
  - Weekend: generally availabile
  - Exceptions might happen due to girlfriend and other social obligations


## Staff titles and current staff

* admin: access to everything
* gamemaster: access to game altering commands for support purposes
* trialmaster/moderator: gamemaster without game altering, but with access to moderation commands on server and discord
* testmaster: gamemaster powers only on the test server
* promolord: takes care of marketing
* developer: full access to all server code, code reviewed by admin

Current admin: Drak
Current gamemasters: Dioporc, Vee
Current testmasters: Austin, Rotterz, Arvanger
Current promolord: -

Critical things to be done before launch:

* Security hardening of the server infrastructure (I currently have two issues on the radar)
* Fix/work-around all already identified causes of server crashes
* Broadcast all serious GM command usage in a dedicated Discord channel, free for everyone to review
* Publish server status in regular intervals to Discord: up/down state, number of players online, CPU/memory load
* Scheduled database backup once per day, pushed elsewhere
* Terms, rules and privacy statement are formulated
* Launch GM team and launch marketing strategy are identified

Desired state of the game server before launch:

* Fix spell scaling, mid-air reflectors, broken core class spells
* All launch PvE content content should be playable without regular manual GM interaction

All accounts and characters will be wiped between test phases.

! If the set goals are not realisticly attainable during the first month of development, before launch or !
! closely after, the project might be canceled and losses cut early.                                      !

## Technical server foundation

The current test server is based on stock mangoszero, a good foundation for further development.
The evaluation of the Elysium server would also be an option. But I think it is a bad foundation,
because it is a code snapshot, poorly documented and only developed further in scattered, private projects.
Custom changes to the game server/database will be released to the public.
All server related changes can be developed publicly, no need for a "trust hierarchy" for server development.
Infrastructure code and scripts (e.g. account creator, server management tools) will remain private.

The emulators cmangos and lh-server were also evaluated, but deemed less suitable than mangoszero.


## Server mechanics as voted by early testers

* 12x highrate server
* Easier honor ranking system (either reduced RP requirements or less decay)
* BG marks can be vendored for gold, mount costs reduced, respeccing cost greatly reduced
* Content release in stages, no seasons
* No multiboxing allowed at all (bank accounts/chars etc. are fine)
* No rewards for staff activity, staff needs to conceal character identities
