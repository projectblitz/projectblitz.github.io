## Context

Official Classic is announced and will be released some day.
There are plenty of 1x Vanilla servers with corrupt staff looking for the next quick cash grab.
Servers are volatile, thus 1x rates are inappropriate for adults looking for Vanilla endgame.

Project Blitz was initiated on Friday the 13th of July 2018, after "NeoFeenix" failed.
One day later a test server was set up and made available to the community.

Project Blitz is intended to end (latest), when official Classic (beta) servers can be played.
When the project ends, a database dump without account names/password hashes might be published.


## Project Blitz key values

* Transparent processes, automation and community involvement
* Attainable Vanilla experience for people playing less than full-time
* Play-worthy server, not targetting the 1x "full bli*zlike" 10000 player crowd
* PvP is no afterthought
* PvE scripting does not need to be perfect, but playable


## The hardware, money, staff and the admin

* The server has good hardware and should be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent players
* The server is located in Warsaw and advertised as "DDoS protection included", will see how this holds

* Current operational cost: 65.99 Euro per month, handled by my private funds
* There will not be a donation/cash shop ever

* All work is done by volunteers without compensation, passionate players of Vanilla

* I am a professional software engineer and will remain the only admin with access to the infrastructure
* Since I am kind of a bottleneck, I will give updates on my availability in Discord
* My current default availability schedule:

  - Mon: 20:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Tue: 22:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Wed: 20:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Thu: 22:00 - 24:00 +/- 1h
  - Fri: 23:00 - 24:00 + 1 or 2h
  - Weekend: generally availabile
  - Exceptions might happen due to girlfriend and other social obligations


## Roadmap

The server is currently in the first testing phase and paid for until 13th of August.
I intend to have another test phase close to launch, testing the launch state of the server.
All accounts and characters will be wiped between test phases.

Critical things to be done before launch:

* Security hardening of the server infrastructure (I currently have two issues on the radar)
* Fix/work-around all already identified causes of server crashes
* Broadcast all serious GM command usage in a dedicated Discord channel, free for everyone to review
* Publish server status in regular intervals to Discord: up/down state, number of players online, CPU/memory load
* Scheduled database backup once per day, pushed elsewhere
* Terms, rules and privacy statement are formulated
* Launch GM team and launch marketing strategy are identified

Desired state of the game server before launch:

* Fix spell scaling, mid-air reflectors, broken core class spells
* All launch PvE content content should be playable without regular manual GM interaction

## Technical server foundation

The current test server is based on stock mangoszero, a good foundation for further development.
The evaluation of the Elysium server would also be an option. But I think it is a bad foundation,
because it is a code snapshot, poorly documented and only developed further in scattered, private projects.
Custom changes to the game server/database will be released to the public.
All server related changes can be developed publicly, no need for a "trust hierarchy" for server development.
Infrastructure code and scripts (e.g. account creator, server management tools) will remain private.


## Server mechanics proposals

Set of orthogonal ideas, that can be combined to a launch server concept. Open for discussion.

1.a High-rate XP, 12x - 24x XP, 2x prof gain, max. weapon skills at levelup, no class training costs
  + Low development effort
  - Might not be attractive enough on a potentially low population server

1.b Instant 60
  + Easy start
  - Easy for exploiters, hackers, too
  - Additional custom development effort for starter gear NPCs

1.c Like 1.a but big loot/gold packages at the end of leveling dungeons (suggested by Vee)
  + Makes clearing dungeons more valuable during high-rate leveling
  + Might attract some of the 1x crowd looking for leveling dungeon experience
  - Additional custom development effort for the loot packages

1.d No or lower honor decay
  + More people having access to highly competive gear, esp. on low-pop
  - R14 will be less exclusive

  If no decay is combined with 2. (Seasons), the 2% most active PvPers will reach r14 (again)
  after 2 weeks, if they were at least r10 before, the ~14% most active PvPers will reach r14
  (again, if r10 before) after maximum 3 weeks and the ~29% most active PvPers will reach r14
  (again, if r10 before) after maximum 4 weeks.

1.e BG marks can be vendored for gold

1.f Reduced mount/training costs


2. Seasons
  * 2 - 6 months long, after that certain items and ranks get removed/reset,
    20% gold cut, 20% (min 1) cut of all stackable items
  * Hall-of-fame for r13+ (first and all attainees), raid endboss kills (first and all guilds)
  * Hall-of-fame could be hosted beyond the lifetime of the project on GitHub
  + More balanced/diverse PvP experience
  + Gold and consumable cut naturally helps against exploiters, botters, gold sellers
  + Relatively easy to implement
  - If poorly communicated, might piss off alot people wondering where their stuff went

  Concrete proposal on the gear cut per season:
  * Remove all Chrom+ items, except T2 set items, making T2 sets a PvE savepoint
  * All rankers above r10 will be reset to r10
  * If they reached r12 or higher, their highest rank will remain r12, making r12 the PvP safepoint
  * 20man, rep items or legendaries will never be cut


3.a Release content in stages
  1. Release: all 60 dungeons, BGs and items at 1.12 state, MC, Ony
  2. BWL, ZG
  3. AQ20, AQ40
  4. Naxx

3.b Release all content at launch, gear check bosses as natural progress blockers


4.a Ban multiboxing, no player should be online with more than 2 accounts (main + bank) at once

4.b Allow multiboxing in PvE (max. 5/20/40 parallel accounts?)
